    1. What is Semantic HTML? 
    Semantic HTML means meaningful HTML. Tags such as <section> <header> <body> that easily denote by reading the title what the following content will be.
    2. What is HTML used for? 
    HTML is used as the structure of a webpage. It is the foundation. It is used to create the rubric for the CSS, and Javascript to style. It was originally
    based on a newspaper.
    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
    An attribute is something supplies additional information/data. It follows the tag. For instance, href in <a href="https://insertlinkhere.com</a> is the 
    attribute, or <img src="thisistheimagelink"> the "src" would be the attribute.
    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
    The h1 is the most important header on a webpage. Similar to a newspaper, it would be the big !HEADER! that would catch your attention. It should only be 
    used once. h1 is huge for SEO (search engine optimization.) The google robots will find your page heavily based on what is labeled as your h1, having 
    multiple could confuse the search engine results, as well as potentially making your webpage more difficult for screen reader impaired users to navigate 
    your page.
    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
    Two tags that have required attributes are the <img> tag and the <a> anchor tag.
    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
    In the head of our HTML document we put all of the information that the web page viewer will not see (besides the <title>) our style sheets (CSS, etc), our 
    metadata.
    7. What is an id? 
    An ID is an HTML attribute that is used to specify and point to ONE element, etc, often used for styling in CSS.
    8. What elements can I add an id to?

    You *should* use an ID only once.
    10. What is a class? 
    A class is similar to an ID, an attribute, however it can be used multiple or as many times as you want through your HTML. Again, often used for styling in
    CSS.
    11. What elements can I add a class to? 
    You can add a class attribute to any element.
    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
    You can use the same class on a page essentially an unlimited number of times.
    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
    You can get your link to open in a new tab by adding the target="_blank" attribute to the anchor tag. Ex: <a href="https://mywebpage.com" target="_blank">.
    14. What is the alt attribute in the image tag used for? 
    The alt attribute is used to add more data to an image, to *describe* the image especially for visually impaired users, when their screen readers go over
    the image they can they read out the description of the image that the "alt" tag has added to understand what has been posted.
    15. How do I reference an id?
    In order to reference an ID you use the "#" symbol.
    16. What is the difference between a section and a div
    The difference between a section and a div is that a div is a block level element.
    17. What is CSS used for?

    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
    h2 {

    }
    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
    You might use a class to select every <p> element on the page because you want them all to be styled the same way. You may use an ID attribute to style 
    your h1 heading that you want to be styled differently from every other element on the page to stand out.
    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
    We select classes by using "."
    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
    #human 
    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
    A parent child selector selects the children of the parent element. 
    For instance 
    <main>
        <ul>
            <li>My name is Sarah Rose Cooper.</li>
            <li>My favorite color is baby pink.</li>
        </ul>
  
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Commodi, ex! 
  Labore delectus nisi dolor, fugit harum quae est. Commodi placeat quas 
  aut necessitatibus ab laudantium libero at neque consequatur porro.

It is useful because of specificity and it makes it easier to target specific elements.

    ls
    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
    rm: You have to be careful because unlike what the average computer user has grown accustomed to on standarad platforms, we are used to 
    receiving a warning of sorts before deleting *anything*. The terminal gives no such thing, once you press enter it's gone, irretrievable 
    from any "trash" or "recycle bin" it's just gone.
    34. Why should I use version control? 
    Version control is very valued because no more of the save, new file, save, new file game and disorganization, no fear of losing work because you
    messed up and can't figure out where or how you messed up and no ability to go back and find out, and also fantastic for working across teams; i.e.
    every one could be 5 people could be 30 working on the same project at the same time making different changes instead of overlapping or conflicting,
    it easy to all be on the same page.
    35. How often should I commit to github?
    Often. Every time you make a significant change, figure out something that you have been trying to solve forever, any time you add a new thing that 
    changes eomething.
    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
    git push origin sarah-cooper
    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
    Create your own repo by forking from the main. Clone your repositary into GIT. Be sure that you have added your TL as a collaborator. Create a branch 
    with your first and last name. Do NOT copy to the main branch. Be sure to add and regularly commit. Make sure to add meaningful "messages" when you
    commut.  Upon finishing push your project to the repo (your branch). Create a new pull request under your forked branch. Add your TL as a reviewer and 
    submit pull request. Your TL will merge the pull request after they have reviewed.
Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    An inline element is an element that is on the same line, for instance, <span> a block element gets its own line, for instance <div>
    Ex: I am a <span>inline element</span.
    <div>
    Above is what is considered a block element.
    </div>
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    The element is positioned in a way that is out of the flow of the other elements. To the other elements, it is as if it doesn't exist.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    Box-model.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    1.) Block by default: <li>, <div>, <main>
    2.) Inline by default: <a>, <img>, <span>
    3.) Inline-block by default: <button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
    Everything in CSS has a box in it and using the box model we can adapt those boxes to our liking. 
    THe box model used padding, content, margin, and width to control the boxes. 
    In order to respect the width we've given a box we can use box-sizing: border-box.
